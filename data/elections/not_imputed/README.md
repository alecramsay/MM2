# Not Imputed

The elections in this folder are *not* imputed.

Note: The order of the columns is the same as for all the imputed elections, 
except for the 2006 and 2008 elections which have Dem then Rep and not vice versa.
That's the order in which those official results were reported. 
It doesn't affect the processing.
