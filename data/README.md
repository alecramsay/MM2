# Data

## Census Data

These came from:
 
- https://www.census.gov/data/tables/1990/dec/1990-apportionment-data.html
- https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2000/dec/2000-apportionment-data.html (Table 1)
- https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010-apportionment-data.html (Table 1)
- https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/dec/2020-apportionment-data.html (Table 1)

The oldest census available digitally is 1990. 
For 1970 and 1980, the reports were only available as PDF’s:

- https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/ApportionmentInformation-1970Census.pdf
- https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/ApportionmentInformation-1980Census.pdf

I downloaded these, scraped the data into spreadsheets, and then converted them to CSV’s.

## Election Results

These came from the [US House](https://github.com/alecramsay/ushouse) and
incorporate imputed results for uncontested elections.
